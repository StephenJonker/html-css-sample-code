Hello World HTML sampel code

This is a basic "Hello World!" done in HTML
Ya, just gotta have one of these

There is also some basic css applied to the page, taking care of things like;
- margin spacing and padding
- some basic colors
- turning on boarders to show spacing

Really nothing magic here, just a start.
